# WORK IN PROGRESS TODO APP

## What is this?

This is a **work in progress** to-do app that I, Ardy Kamdani, am building as a showcase of my basic abilities. To-do apps are inherently very simple, allowing users to create, update, delete, and view lists. However, there are always more features that can be added - or even unnecessary complexities(for example, integrating redux) that can be implemented, and thus this is a living project that I will contribute to over time. As this is currently a work in progress prior to its first release version, the code structure is **not** reflective of my actual abilities. There will be components that should be refactored and incomplete test cases, and so if you are reading this, please check back in a few days.

## Running the Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
